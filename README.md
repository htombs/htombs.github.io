# my-profile-website
this is my profile website showcasing me as a person, my accomplishments and hopefully making me more hirable to future employers

## Home-Page (html)

### header: - Home - Story - Employment - Skills -contact details
  - the header will be fixed above each page for ease of use, but only when you clock on a seperate page. So won't show on the home page (html)

#### profile image (pick a cool one)
- underneath will be an accordian/button style with the listed sections in the header, these will only be on the main page and is where the "home" button takes you 
  - Home 
  - Story
  - Employment
  - Skills
  - Contact Details

### footer
at the bottom of the page will be img links (**try 50% opacity and horizontally laid out**) for contact info, this is the same as the "Contact Details" but will look cool on the page//
- linkedin
- gmail
- github
