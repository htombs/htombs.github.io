        <li>Communication has always played a big part in my line of work, especially during my time managing 
            at Saddles and Paddles. I've often had to use multiple communication skills to switch between situations,
            one second I'll be talking to a difficult distributor over a warranty situation, the next I'm expected to 
            talk to a family of 4 who want to know where they can cycle in the area. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In other situations, I've had two back to back customers who have wanted to buy bikes, the first has a broad 
            understanding of bicycle parts, has been riding for several years and wants an in-depth talk through of how the 
            highly specced components all work and how relevent each model will be for their specific type of riding. The other 
            customer has absolutely zero previous knowledge and needs a very simplified chat about bikes with absolutely 
            none of the "jargon" or pressure that people often struggle to avoid.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Having taught all manner of age groups and abilities in my instructing years, I've always been able to carry that 
            ability with me to every job afterwards, and actually find it quite easy to tailer my conversations to who 
            I am currently talking to. This is a skill I think would come in handy with working in the 
            tech world, as I believe communicating with multiple different groups will be extremely useful when problem solving an issue.
